    "  \n",
    "Ampcor (Amplitude cross correlation) in InSAR processing offers an estimate of spatial displacements (offsets) with the feature tracking method. The offsets are in resolutions of pixel or sub-pixel (withc additional oversampling).  \n",

    "In practice, we \n",

    "\n",
    "* perform cross-correlation between the search windows with the reference window, to obtain the normalized correlation surface;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c(u,v) = \\frac {\\sum_{x,y}[R(x,y)-{\\bar R}][S(x+u,y+v)-{\\bar S}_{u,v}]}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}[R]\\text{Var}[S_{u,v}]}}$$\n",
